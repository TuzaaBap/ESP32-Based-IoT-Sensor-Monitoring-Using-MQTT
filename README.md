# ESP32-Based-IoT-Sensor-Monitoring-Using-MQTT
This project implements a simple IoT-based sensor monitoring system using an ESP32 development board. The system collects environmental and water-quality parameters from multiple sensors and publishes the data in real time using the MQTT protocol. The published data can be visualized live using open-source MQTT visualization tools.
